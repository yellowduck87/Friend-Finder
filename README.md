# Friend-Finder

A tinder-like app that will match the user based on the completion of a quiz and determine copatability based on the differences between answers.

This was quite a challenging app to build. Each segment I seemed to run into a problem, but Not too many typos. The Logic to compare the new user's input with the database was the most challenging aspect for me, and I relied heavily on help from my peers. I ended up using a map function to subtract two arrays at the same index. I also added an express-static line of code so I could add some css elements. I'm not sure why I felt so stringly that there needed to be additional syling, but it was good practice for the future.

This app was designed and coded by Megan W Evans.
